    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: February 28, 2026</p>

    <p>
        TrailCoach AI ("we", "us", or "our") operates the <strong>pacia.app</strong> platform
        (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and
        safeguard your information when you use our Service.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
    <p>
        When you create an account, we collect your email address, display name, and
        preferred language. If you sign in via Google OAuth, we receive your name and email
        address from Google — we do not receive or store your Google password.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Profile &amp; Training Data</h3>
    <p>
        To generate personalised training plans, we collect information you provide such as
        your date of birth, gender, weekly running volume, longest recent run, target race
        details, and training preferences.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 Wearable &amp; Activity Data</h3>
    <p>
        When you connect a wearable provider (Garmin Connect, Strava), we receive activity
        data from those services, including: activity type, date, duration, distance, pace,
        heart rate, cadence, elevation, and GPS route data (GPX/FIT/TCX files). We only
        access the data scopes you explicitly authorise.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Garmin Connect:</strong> We use the Garmin Health API to receive activity
        summaries and workout files that you authorise. We do not access your Garmin account
        credentials. You can revoke access at any time from your TrailCoach AI profile
        connections page or from the Garmin Connect app.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Strava:</strong> We use the Strava API v3 to receive activity data that you
        authorise. We do not access your Strava account credentials. You can revoke access
        at any time from your TrailCoach AI profile connections page or from Strava settings.
    </p>

    <h3>1.4 AI Interaction Data</h3>
    <p>
        When we generate training plans or analyse your sessions using AI, we store the model
        used, a hash of the prompt, the knowledge base chunks referenced, and the generated
        output. We do not share your personal data with third-party AI providers — your data
        is processed on our own infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h3>1.5 Cookies &amp; Technical Data</h3>
    <p>
        We use essential cookies for session management and CSRF protection. With your
        consent, we may use analytics cookies to understand how the Service is used. We
        collect standard server logs (IP address, browser type, pages visited) for security
        and performance monitoring.
    </p>
